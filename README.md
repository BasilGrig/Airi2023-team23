Neural network methods for filling gaps in satellite images.  

In this work 3 methods were compared: UNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08877), FNO2D (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895), STpconvnet (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08781).  

test_fno2d - launch to train and predict with FNO2D.  

test_STpconv - launch to train and predict with STpconvnet (were used this code https://github.com/appelmar/STpconv).  

test_unet - launch to train and predict with UNet (does not work in this version)

compare - script to compare results.  

Attention!!!You should use your own data to train and evaluate model
