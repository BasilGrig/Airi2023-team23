Neural network methods for filling gaps in satellite images /n
In this work 3 methods were compared: UNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08877), FNO2D (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895), STpconvnet (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08781) /n
test_fno2d - launch to train and predict with FNO2D /n
test_STpconv - launch to train and predict with STpconvnet (were used this code https://github.com/appelmar/STpconv)/n
compare - script to compare results /n
Attention!!! /n
You should use your own data to train and evaluate model
